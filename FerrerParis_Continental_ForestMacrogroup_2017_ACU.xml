<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types. </Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.A.1.Ea.134 - Caribbean Coastal Lowland Dry Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.1.Ea Caribbeo-Mesoamerican Dry Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). This ecosystem is composed of high density forests with small to medium trees, and covered in a layer without emerging trees. Variation in the dry season period, topography and substrate determine the specific characteristics of the vegetation communities since all of them are of great importance in dry forests as determinants of variation in water availability. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It is found in South Florida, the Florida Keys, the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago and the Windward Islands.</AT-description>

<Processes-Summary lang="en">The Caribbean dry forest region is composed short in stature forests, high in density with small and medium trees, often composed of one stratum without emerging trees. The herbaceous layer is poorly developed or completely absent. Floristic diversity is low compared to the wettest forests, with prevalence of few species. These forests tend to have a dense evergreen canopy that produces deeper shade, less evaporation, and lower air temperatures than the surrounding vegetation. This ecological system occurs as a narrow band of broadleaf and scrub forest. The vegetation is characterized by hardwood tropical species. Variation in the dry season period, topography and substrate determine the specific characteristics of the vegetation communities in this macrogroup, considering this communities are of great importance in dry forests as determinants of variation in water availability. </Processes-Summary>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup  '1.A.1.Ea.134 - Caribbean Coastal Lowland Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 56.3 (20.7-75.9) % in the past 50 years, 83.3 (63.5-92.4) % historically, and 0% in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 18.3% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 31.5% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 69.9% in a 50-year period, however, 80% of the extent had a relative severity of 56.7% or higher. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered with plausible bounds from Endangered to Critically Endangered under subcriteria A1, A3 and D2b.</RA-Summary>

<Summaries>
<Summary lang="en">For the Caribbean Coastal Lowland Dry Forest  macrogroup, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 56.3% in the past 50 years and 83.3% historically; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion A1 and A3.</Summary>

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 was used. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area.

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">For criterion D large vertebrates (and specially large mammals) were considered as a characteristic component of forests, and their due to overexploitation has an impact in important biotic associations in ecosystems (Galetti and Dirzo 2013; Dirzo et al. 2014).  Estimates of hunting-depletion distances was used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale was not found, but increased human use intensity could be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resourse use intensity was a mean relative severity of 18.3% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 31.5% historically, while potential defaunation will have 69.9% severity, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriteria D2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables was implemented: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage was transformed. For negative RR values the decline was expressed as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values a zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. The formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.A.1.Ea.294 - Caribbean Dry Limestone Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.1.Ea Caribbeo-Mesoamerican Dry Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). The macrogroup is characterized by two seasons, dry season lasts from two to several months with annual precipitation of 800 to 1500 mm. The Caribbean Dry Limestone Forest is composed by low species richness with high plant endemism; forest canopy is partially open, composed by deciduous vegetation with 6 to 15 m high, emerging trees can be registered only in places with the highest rainfall. An understory layer is sometime present composed of evergreen vegetation and herbaceous vegetation is scarce. A list of 70 characteristic species could be extracted from descriptive profiles of the Macrogroup. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It is found in Cuba, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and probably in other Caribbean islands.</AT-description>

Forest canopy is partially open, composed of deciduous vegetation with 6 to 15 m high, emerging trees can be registered only in places with the highest rainfall. An understory layer is sometimes present composed of evergreen vegetation and herbaceous vegetation is scarce. Two regions can be differentiated according to their plant physiognomy: (a) Karst forests are characterized by small-diameter trees in high density with deciduous and scleromorphic leaves; at the base of mogotes mesic forests in this region, trees with a height of 25 to 30 m, closed canopy, and evergreen species could be found. In Cuban mogotes, the forest is constituted by trees from 10 to 16 m in height, an open canopy of deciduous trees with barrel trunks, and abundant columnar cacti, bromeliads and sclerophyllous shrubs and trees. (b) The submontane or montane rain forests are present in small patches in Puerto Rico (less than 600 masl) and in the Karst mountain (up to 1100 masl), these are composed of drought-tolerant deciduous trees with an open canopy (6-8 m high), the shrub layer is dense with 2 to 3 m high with rocks and trunks covered with moss and epiphytes.</Processes-Summary>

En la base de mogotes el bosque puede ser mésico con una altura de 25 a 30 m, y un dosel cerrado de especies de hoja perenne. En las laderas y cimas la vegetación es un bosque caducifolio / bosques con árboles de 16 a 18 metros y hojas esclerófilas. En mogotes cubanos, el bosque tiene una pendiente de 10 a 16 m de altura de dosel abierto de árboles de hoja caduca con troncos de barril y abundantes cactáceas columnares, bromelias y diversas formas de arbustos y árboles esclerófilos. 2.- Presenta pequeños parches los bosques lluvioso submontano o  montano (Puerto Rico menor a 600m de altitud  y hasta 1100 m en las montañas kársticas). Se compone de árboles de hoja cauducifolia tolerantes a la sequía con un dosel abierto (6-8 m de altura). El estrato arbustivo es de 2-3 m de altura y muy denso. Las rocas y los troncos están cubiertos por musgos y epífitas. </Processes-Summary>

The macrogroup is characterized by two seasons, dry season lasts from two to several months with annual precipitation of 800 to 1500 mm. The Caribbean Dry Limestone Forest is composed by low species richness with high plant endemism; forest canopy is partially open, composed by deciduous vegetation with 6 to 15 m high, emerging trees can be registered only in places with the highest rainfall. An understory layer is sometime present composed of evergreen vegetation and herbaceous vegetation is scarce. A list of 70 characteristic species could be extracted from descriptive profiles of the Macrogroup. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It is found in Cuba, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and probably in other Caribbean islands.</Subset-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup  '1.A.1.Ea.294 - Caribbean Dry Limestone Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 43.1 (29.0 - 54.5) % in the past 50 years, 72.4 (64.6 - 78.4) % historically, and 25.6 (15.0 - 34.9) % in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 10% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 24.8% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 70 % in a 50-year period. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriteria A3 and D2b.</RA-Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 was used. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover  two time series of data was considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS  (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover was used the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 400 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1750 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) was applied for the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters, distance to markets for wildlife products and level of protection (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Then, transformed the spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. Potential defaunation mean relative severity was of 70% severity over 100% of its extent in the next 50 years; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion D2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010)⁠ and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017)⁠⁠, the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values  zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed as its represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. Then, it was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

The class 'Natural woodlands' was assumed it represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential'). Equal step weights for changes between consecutive classes was assumed, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. No quantitative estimate of collapse was obtained, but assume that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential').</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types. </Assessment-summary>

<RA-Summaries>
<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.1.Ea.296 - Caribbean and Mesoamerican Pine-Oak Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 34.2 (21.3-45.0 )% in the past 50 years, 58.4 (51.4-64.4)% historically, and 32.5 (21.9-41.7)% in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 47.8%, however, 80% of the extent had a relative severity of 34% or higher in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 58.4 (51.4-64.4)% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 42.8% in a 50-year period. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable under subcriteria A1, A3 and D2b.</RA-Summary>

<Summaries>
<Summary lang="en">The presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: woodlands cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover was of 34.2% in the past 50 years and 58.4% historically; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion A1 and A3.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 was used. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">The presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroup. For contemporary forest cover was averaged percent tree cover from two time series of remote sensing data for each year between 2001 and 2012, and it was calculated the proportional rate of decline (PRD) and used the difference in the predicted forest cover in 2001 and 2051 as an estimate of expected decline in any 50 year period including past, present and future.  Mean estimated decline was 0 (0.0 - 0.0) %, and it did not reach any of the thresholds for Vulnerable. Woodland cover was of 32.5 (21.9-41.7)% in a 50-year period. This is very close to the minimum threshold to assign a risk category; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened (plausible bounds from Leas Concern to Vulnerable) under subcriterion A2b.</Summary>

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover it was considered two time series of data: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS  (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which it was calculated total forest cover per year. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Then, it was averaged percenttree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). It was used a cutoff value of 25% tree cover to determine presence, overlaped this with a 10x10 km grid, and counted the number of 10x10 km cells that had at least 1% of their area occupied the the ecosystem.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">Climate conditions are generally considered of great importance for the maintainance of forest vegetation and characteristic processes of several macrogroups, and were also incorporated in the process of macrogroup potential distribution modeling and validation. Thus it was considered climate change as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but reliable indicator for changes was not found in fire regime at the continental scale. Flood regime was not considered to be relevant to this ecosystem and was not evaluated.

<Summary lang="en">Climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions as it might influence both the predominant growth form and characteristic biota. A set of 19 standard bioclimatic variables was used as indicators of characteristic environmental conditions (Hijmans et al. 2005) and used a Random Forest Classification algorithm to evaluate suitability of environmental conditions under current climate and future projections based on climate change models. The probability of the target macrogroup was evaluated to be replaced by any forest or non-forest vegetation macrogroup under changing climatic conditions.

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables was selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions  and compared current and future conditions. “Current” climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005)⁠; while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014)⁠. All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). A *random forest* (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. Then partition data in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then the RF model was fittedwith the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and  different threshold of model support (proportion of “votes”, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box was used RF-model prediction (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions was compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP was summarized to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

Recent estimates of hunting-depletion distances were used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). No reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale were found, but it was considered that increased human use intensity could be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was of 47.8%, however, 80% of the extent had a relative severity of 34% or higher in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 58.4 (51.4-64.4)% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 42.8% in a 50-year period, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable under subcriteria D1 and D2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed as its represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. Then, it was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.A.1.Ea.561 - Caribbean and Mesoamerican Seasonal Dry Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.1.Ea Caribbeo-Mesoamerican Dry Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). This macrogroup is characterized by seasonally dry climate with annual rainfall between 1000 and 1500 mm with an average temperature above 24°C. The Caribbean and Mesoamerican Seasonal Dry Forest is low to medium in stratum height, with most species being deciduous. This system borders on premontane wet forests, with some communities closer to the coast characterized by numerous arborescent cactuses. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats.  It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. It is distributed in dry valleys of Guatemala and Honduras, Mexico along the Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra de San Carlos, Sierra de Tamaulipas, Yucatan Peninsula and northeastern plateau. </AT-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.1.Ea.561 - Caribbean and Mesoamerican Seasonal Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 29.5 (22.6-35.9)% in the past 50 years, 54.9 (51.3-58.3)% historically, and 0% in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 14.4% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 50.2% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 50.2% in a 50-year period, however, 80 % of the extent had a relative severity of 30.7 % or higher.

Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: woodlands cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 54.9 (51.3-58.3) % historically; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under subcriterion A3.</Summary>

Historical changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of reconstructed land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. Woodland cover was used to estimate changes in forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. Woodland cover decline was of 29.5 (22.6-35.9) % in the past 50 years.

The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in resource use intensity were estimated by reclassifying the reconstructed land cover classes for 1900 and 2000 from the Anthrome products (Ellis et al. 2010). The potential distribution of the Macrogroup was crossed with the distinct woodland cover classes, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). The class 'Natural woodlands' were assumed to represent natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural' less than 'Used' less than 'Populated' less than 'Residential'). Equal step weights were considered for changes between consecutive classes, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse is not available, but it is assumed that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters, distance to markets for wildlife products and level of protection (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Then the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. Potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 50.2 % severity over 100% of its extent in the next 50 years; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable under subcriterion D2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<Subset-description lang="en">The '1.A.1.Ea.562 - Pacific Mesoamerican Seasonal Dry Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.1.Ea Caribbeo-Mesoamerican Dry Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This forest has a high density of small stems and vines (9-12 m), it is compound by tropical deciduous tree species and dominates the canopy at multilevel complex levels. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It is foundfrom the Pacific Basin from Mexico to Panama.</Subset-description>

Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: woodlands cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b).

Historical changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of reconstructed land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. Woodland cover was used to estimate changes in forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. Woodland cover decline was of 50.5 (23.4-68.0) %, in the past 50 years; thus, the ecosystem could be classified as Endangered under subcriterion A1.

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 was used. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

For contemporary forest cover was averaged percent tree cover from two time series of remote sensing data for each year between 2001 and 2012, and it was calculated the proportional rate of decline (PRD) and used the difference in the predicted forest cover in 2001 and 2051 as an estimate of expected decline in any 50 year period including past, present and future. Woodland cover decline was of 0 (0.0 - 0.0) % in a 50-year period.

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover  two time series of data was considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS  (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">Climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions as it might influence both the predominant growth form and characteristic biota. A set of 19 standard bioclimatic variables was used was used as indicators of characteristic environmental conditions (Hijmans et al. 2005) and used a Random Forest Classification algorithm to evaluate suitability of environmental conditions under current climate and future projections based on climate change models. The probability of the target macrogroup was evaluated to be replaced by any forest or non-forest vegetation macrogroup under changing climatic conditions. Nevertheless, flood regime estimates was inconsistent, thus, considering no reliable information is available to assess this macrogroup this subcriterion was not assessed.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables was selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions  and compared current and future conditions. “Current” climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014)⁠. All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). A *random forest* (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. Then partition data in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then the RF model was fittedwith the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and  different threshold of model support (proportion of “votes”, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box was used RF-model prediction (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions was compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP was summarized to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010)⁠ and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values  zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed as its represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. Then, it was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.1.Ei.563 - Guajiran Seasonal Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 46.8 (35.4-56.2) % in the past 50 years, 77.2 (71.2-82.0) % historically, and 0 (0.0-7.5) % in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Environmental degradation of 31.1 (25.0-39.0) % severity over 100% of its extent in the next 50 years. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 20.6% severity over 100% of its extent in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 15.1% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 56.6% in 100% of the extent in a 50-year period. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriteria A3.</RA-Summary>

Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: woodlands cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover declined 46.8 (35.4-56.2) % in the past 50 years, 77.2 (71.2-82.0) % historically, and 0 (0.0-7.5) % in a 50-year period; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion A3.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 was used. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

For contemporary forest cover was averaged percent tree cover from two time series of remote sensing data for each year between 2001 and 2012, and it was calculated the proportional rate of decline (PRD) and used the difference in the predicted forest cover in 2001 and 2051 as an estimate of expected decline in any 50 year period including past, present and future.  Mean estimated decline was 0 (0.0 - 0.0) %, and it did not reach any of the thresholds for Vulnerable. Woodland cover was of  0 (0.0-7.5) % in a 50-year period.

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover  two time series of data was considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS  (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

For historical representation of forest cover was used the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. from which it was calculated total forest cover per year and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 400 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1750 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

A set of 19 standard bioclimatic variables was used was used as indicators of characteristic environmental conditions (Hijmans et al. 2005) and used a Random Forest Classification algorithm to evaluate suitability of environmental conditions under current climate and future projections based on climate change models. The probability of the target macrogroup was evaluated to be replaced by any forest or non-forest vegetation macrogroup under changing climatic conditions. Environmental degradation was of 31.1 (25.0-39.0)% severity over 100% of its extent in the next 50 years.

<Data-description lang="en">We selected a group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables as indicators of overall environmental conditions  and compared current and future conditions. “Current” climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). We used the *random forest* (RF) algorithm, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First we define a bounding box around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location we record the potential macrogroup according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. We partition the data in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then we fitted the RF model with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and  different threshold of model support (proportion of “votes”, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box we used RF-model prediction (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). We compared predictions based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). We summarized the results of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017)⁠. This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

Recent estimates of hunting-depletion distances were used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). No reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale were found, but it was considered that increased human use intensity could be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was of 20.6% severity over 100% of its extent in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 15.1% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 56.6% in 100% of the extent in a 50-year period; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable under subcriterion D2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values  zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed as its represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. Then, it was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in resource use intensity was estimated by reclassifying the reconstructed land cover classes for 1700 and 2000 from the Anthrome products (Ellis et al. 2010). The potential distribution of the Macrogroup was crossed with the distinct woodland cover classes, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). The class 'Natural woodlands' was assumed it represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential'). Equal step weights for changes between consecutive classes was assumed, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. No quantitative estimate of collapse was obtained, but assume that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential').</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types. </Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.A.1.Ei.565 - Llanos Seasonal Dry Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.1.Ei Colombian-Venezuelan Dry Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. The Llanos Seasonal Dry Forest is characterized by low-density forest with heights between 6 and 14 m; with predominance of deciduous species, it commonly forms mosaics with savannas characterized by moderately drained soils with high nutrient content. This macrogroup is presented through the Llanos of Colombia and Venezuela, bordering the humid forests of the Orinoquia. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats.</AT-description>

For assessing disruption to biotic processes and interactions under criterion D it was assumed that most of the fundamental processes and interactions disappeared with intensive use of woodlands under high population density.

The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 16.9% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 15.5% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 69.9% in a 50-year period, however, 80% of the extent had a relative severity of 43% or higher. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered with plausible bounds from Vulnerable to Endangered under subcriteria A1 and A3.</RA-Summary>

<Summaries>
<Summary lang="en">In the Llanos Seasonal Dry Forest, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: woodlands cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 54.1 (23.9-72.3) % in the past 50 years and 41.4 (14.7-59.8) % historically; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered with plausible bounds from Endangered to Critically Endangered under subcriterion A1 and A3.</Summary>

The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years.

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">For criterion D large vertebrates (and specially large mammals) were considered as a characteristic component of forests, and their due to overexploitation has an impact in important biotic associations in ecosystems (Galetti and Dirzo 2013; Dirzo et al. 2014).  Estimates of hunting-depletion distances was used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale was not found, but increased human use intensity could be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resourse use intensity was a mean relative severity of 16.9% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 15.5% historically, while potential defaunation will have 43% severity, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriteria D2b.</Summary>

<Summary lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) was applied for the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters, distance to markets for wildlife products and level of protection (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Then, transformed the spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. Potential defaunation mean relative severity was of 43% severity over 100% of its extent in a 50-year period.

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values  zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed as its represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. Then, it was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.A.1.Ei.566 - Tumbes Guayaquil Seasonal Dry Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.1.Ei Colombian-Venezuelan Dry Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. The Tumbes Guayaquil Seasonal Dry Forest is characterized by an irregular canopy with a large proportion of deciduous species, dense shrubby and semi-deciduous strata. This ecosytem is characterized by dry deciduous to semi-deciduous forests growing on the coastal plain of Ecuador with a dry season of more than 4 months. They reach up to about 500 m altitude in the hills of the coastal range located in this region and to about 900 m in the foothills of the Andes Mountains to the  south, close to the border with Peru. In Peru it is distributed higher up, to 1500-2000 m elevation in the Amotape hills and further south in the western foothills of the Andes up to northern Lambayeque. In general these forest are 15 20 m tall, have an uneven canopy with a large proportion of deciduous species, and a dense and semi-deciduous shrub layer. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats.</AT-description>

<Subset-description lang="en">The '1.A.1.Ei.566 - Tumbes Guayaquil Seasonal Dry Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.1.Ei Colombian-Venezuelan Dry Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. The Tumbes Guayaquil Seasonal Dry Forest is characterized by an irregular canopy with a large proportion of deciduous species, dense shrubby and semi-deciduous strata. This ecosytem is characterized by dry deciduous to semi-deciduous forests growing on the coastal plain of Ecuador with a dry season of more than 4 months. They reach up to about 500 m altitude in the hills of the coastal range located in this region and to about 900 m in the foothills of the Andes Mountains to the  south, close to the border with Peru. In Peru it is distributed higher up, to 1500-2000 m elevation in the Amotape hills and further south in the western foothills of the Andes up to northern Lambayeque. In general these forest are 15 20 m tall, have an uneven canopy with a large proportion of deciduous species, and a dense and semi-deciduous shrub layer. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats.</Subset-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup  '1.A.1.Ea.134 - Caribbean Coastal Lowland Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 84 (55.2-94.3) % historically, and 97.9 (92.2-99.4)% in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 19.9% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 22.2% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 53.2% in a 50-year period. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Critically Endangered under subcriteria A2b.</RA-Summary>

Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: woodlands cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 84 (55.2-94.3) % historically, and 97.9 (92.2-99.4)% in a 50-year period; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Critically Endangered under subcriterion A2b.</Summary>

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 was used. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area.

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover  two time series of data was considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS  (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

Spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values  zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed as its represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance.

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The '1.A.1.Ej.567 - Central Guianan Seasonal Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 4.5 (3.4-5.6) % in the past 50 years, 8.6 (8.5-8.8) % historically, and 3.4 (2.8-4.1)% in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 2.3% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 31.5% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 1.3% in a 50-year period over 100% of the extent . This estimates are below the minimum threshold to assign a risk category considering spatial and functional criteria; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Least Concern. </RA-Summary>

Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 4.5 (3.4-5.6) % in the past 50 years, 8.6 (8.5-8.8) % historically, and 3.4 (2.8-4.1)% in a 50-year period.

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 was used. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

For contemporary forest cover was averaged percent tree cover from two time series of remote sensing data for each year between 2001 and 2012, and it was calculated the proportional rate of decline (PRD) and used the difference in the predicted forest cover in 2001 and 2051 as an estimate of expected decline in any 50 year period including past, present and future.

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover  two time series of data was considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS  (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

Potential distribution of the Macrogroup with the distinct woodland cover classes was crossed, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). The class 'Natural woodlands' was considered as natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential'). Equal step weights for changes between consecutive classes was used, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse was not available, but assume that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential').</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) was applied for the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters, distance to markets for wildlife products and level of protection (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Then, transformed the spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. Potential defaunation was of 1.3 % severity over 100% of its extent in a 50-year period. This is below the minimum threshold to assign a risk category; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Least Concern under subcriterion D2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables was implemented: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage was transformed. For negative RR values the decline was expressed as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values a zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. The formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.A.1.Ek.568 - Brazilian Atlantic Seasonal Dry Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.1.Ek Brazilian-Parana Dry Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. The Brazilian Atlantic Seasonal Dry Forest' are located in the Brazilian Eastern Shield in the Atlantic border in transition to the west with the Cantinga and the Cerrado. They are distributed towards the states of Parana and Sao Paulo and are more related to the vegetation of the Cerrado.  Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. </AT-description>

Additionally for flooded and swamp forest, ecosystem collapse if the amount of detected surface water within the potential distribution of the macrogroup declined to zero was assumed.  For assessing disruption to biotic processes and interactions under criterion D was assumed that most of the fundamental processes and interactions disappeared with intensive use of woodlands under high population density.

It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. The Brazilian Atlantic Seasonal Dry Forest' are located in the Brazilian Eastern Shield in the Atlantic border in transition to the west with the Cantinga and the Cerrado. They are distributed towards the states of Parana and Sao Paulo and are more related to the vegetation of the Cerrado.  Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats.</Subset-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.1.Ek.568 - Brazilian Atlantic Seasonal Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 82.7 (55.6-93.3) % historically, and 0% in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Climatic conditions degradation was of 39.9 (32.7-47.4) severity in 100% of the extent . Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 17.6% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 42.5% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 47.5% in a 50-year period in 100% of the extent. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered with plausible bounds from Endangered to Critically Endangered under subcriteria A3.</RA-Summary>

<Summary lang="en">For this macrogroup, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 82.7 (55.6-93.3) % historically, and 0% in a 50-year period; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion A3. </Summary>

The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years.

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">Climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions as it might influence both the predominant growth form and characteristic biota. A set of 19 standard bioclimatic variables was used as indicators of characteristic environmental conditions (Hijmans et al. 2005) was used and a Random Forest Classification algorithm to evaluate suitability of environmental conditions under current climate and future projections based on climate change models. The probability of the target macrogroup was evaluated to be replaced by any forest or non-forest vegetation macrogroup under changing climatic conditions. Evironmental degradation was of 39.9 (32.7 -- 47.4) % severity over 100% of its extent in the next 50 years. This is very close to the minimum threshold to assign a risk category; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under subcriterion C2a.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

Estimates of hunting-depletion distances was used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale was not found, but increased human use intensity could be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 17.6% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 42.5% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 47.5% in a 50-year period in 100% of the extent; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable under subcriterion D2b. </Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables was implemented: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage was transformed. For negative RR values the decline was expressed as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values a zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. The formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. The Cerrado Seasonal Dry Forest is composed by partially open forests, medium size trees (20-25 m), multi-layered canopy and abundant lianas. It is located in The Cerrado in Brazil, in the Bolivian lowlands, adjacent to the southwest of the Cerrado, known as the Chiquitana region.</AT-description>

It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. The Cerrado Seasonal Dry Forest is composed by partially open forests, medium size trees (20-25 m), multi-layered canopy and abundant lianas. It is located in The Cerrado in Brazil, in the Bolivian lowlands, adjacent to the southwest of the Cerrado, known as the Chiquitana region.</Subset-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.1.Ek.570 - Cerrado Seasonal Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 43.7 (24-58.3) in the past 50 years, 69.4 (58.2-77.6)% historically, and 65.8 (50.9-76.2) % in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Climatic conditions degradation was of 26 (23.5-29.3) severity in 100% of the extent . Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 14.6% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 21.6% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 28.4% in a 50-year period in 100% of the extent. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered with plausible bounds from Endangered to Critically Endangered under subcriteria A3.</RA-Summary>

<Summary lang="en">For this macrogroup, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 43.7 (24-58.3) in the past 50 years, 69.4 (58.2-77.6)% historically, and 65.8 (50.9-76.2) % in a 50-year period; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion A2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 was used. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover  two time series of data was considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS  (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover was used the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. from which it was calculated total forest cover per year and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 400 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1750 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

Thus climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but no reliable indicator was obtained for changes in fire regime at the continental scale.

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables was implemented: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage was transformed. For negative RR values the decline was expressed as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values a zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. The formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

Potential distribution of the Macrogroup with the distinct woodland cover classes was crossed, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands').

Potential distribution of the Macrogroup with the distinct woodland cover classes was estimated, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). The class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential'). Equal step weights for changes between consecutive classes was considered, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse was not available, but assume that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential').</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This macrogroup is characterized by dry climate, well-drained soils and sandy substrate; changes are manifested by changes in the plant structure, which is shorter, with a more open canopy and less plant diversity.  Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats.

Additionally for flooded and swamp forest, ecosystem collapse if the amount of detected surface water within the potential distribution of the macrogroup declined to zero was assumed.  For assessing disruption to biotic processes and interactions under criterion D was assumed that most of the fundamental processes and interactions disappeared with intensive use of woodlands under high population density. It was also assumed that the ecosystem would collapse if the population of large mammals declined to less than 10% of their original population size.</Functional-collapse>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.1.Ek.571 - Parana Seasonal Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 49.4 (20.4-67.9) % in the past 50 years, 74.3 57.4-84.5) % historically, and 97.6 (95.9-98.7)% in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 52.8% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 36.2% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 43.1% in 100% of the extent. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Critically Endangered under subcriteria A2b.</RA-Summary>

<Summary lang="en">For this macrogroup, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline of 49.4 (20.4-67.9) % in the past 50 years, 74.3 57.4-84.5) % historically, and 97.6 (95.9-98.7)% in a 50-year period; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Critically Endangered under subcriterion A2b.</Summary>

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">For criterion D large vertebrates (and specially large mammals) were considered as a characteristic component of forests, and their due to overexploitation has an impact in important biotic associations in ecosystems (Galetti and Dirzo 2013; Dirzo et al. 2014).  Estimates of hunting-depletion distances was used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale was not found, but increased human use intensity could be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 52.8% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 36.2% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 43.1% in 100% of the extent; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable under criterion D.</Summary>

<Summary lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) was applied for the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters, distance to markets for wildlife products and level of protection (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Then, transformed the spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. Potential defaunation was of 43.1 % severity over 100% of its extent in a 50-year period. This is very close to the minimum threshold to assign a risk category; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under subcriterion D2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables was implemented: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage was transformed. For negative RR values the decline was expressed as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values a zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. The formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

 <Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This ecosystem is characterized by calcareous substrates and sites with higher availability of nutrients; 15-20 m high forests with vines, creepers and epiphytes. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It occurs on slopes of low inclination and with peripheral positions to the west and southwest (sites in Bahia and north of Mina Gerais).</AT-description>

 <RA-Summaries>
   <RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.1.Ek.572 - Caatinga Seasonal Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that, at the present rate of decline in tree cover, the geographic distribution was 32.7 (19.5-43.6)% in the past 50 years, 96.8 (87.4-99.2) % in a 50-year period and 54.1 (47.2-60.2)% historically. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Changes in climate conditions mean relative severity will be 12.8 (11.4-15.7) % in the next 50 years. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 20.6%, however, 82.3% of the extent had a relative severity of 30% or higher in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity was 49.7% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 45.6%, however, 50.8% of the extent had a relative severity of 50 % or higher. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Critically Endangered under subcriterion A2b.</RA-Summary>

<Summary lang="en">For the Caatinga Seasonal Dry Forest, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was 32.7 (19.5-43.6)% in the past 50 years, 96.8 (87.4-99.2) % in a 50-year period and 54.1 (47.2-60.2)% historically, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Critically Endangered under subcriterion A2b.</Summary>

The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover.

The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area.

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averdaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover two time series of data were considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Then, percent tree cover was averaged from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). A cutoff value of 25% tree cover was used to determine presence, overlaped this with a 10x10 km grid, and counted the number of 10x10 km cells that had at least 1% of their area occupied the the ecosystem.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">Climate conditions are generally considered of great importance for the maintainance of forest vegetation and characteristic processes of several macrogroups, and were also incorporated in the process of macrogroup potential distribution modeling and validation. Thus climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but no reliable indicator was obtained for changes in fire regime at the continental scale. Flood regime was not considered to be relevant to this ecosystem and was not evaluated.

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

 <Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

 <AT-description lang="en">The '1.A.1.Ek.872 Cerradao Sclerophyllous Woodland' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.1.Ek Brazilian-Parana Dry Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. In this macrogroup soils vary widely, from mesotrophic with high calcium content to lateritic and acidic, or very shallow; this is a transition between the seasonal dry forest and the Cerrado savannas, with a tree covermore than 50% and trees 7 to 15 m high, with a richness and variety of shrubs and grasslands. Characteristic species are generally seasonal and with xeromorphic characteristics. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It is located in Brasil, Bolivia and Paraguay from El Cerrado biogeographic region.</AT-description>

 <RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.1.Ek.872 Cerradao Sclerophyllous Woodland' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 52.9 (24.9-70.5) % in the past 50 years, will be 66.4 (34.5-82.8) % in a 50-year period, and 79.8 (64.1-88.7) % historically. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 16.5 % over 100% of the extent in the past 50 years and 24.8 % over 100% of its extent historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 29.7 % over 100% of the extent in a 50-year period. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriteria A1 and A3.</RA-Summary>

<Summary lang="en">For the Cerradao Sclerophyllous Woodland, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was 52.9 (24.9-70.5) % in the past 50 years, will be 66.4 (34.5-82.8) % in a 50-year period, and 79.8 (64.1-88.7) % historically, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriteria A1 and A3.</Summary>

<Summary lang="en">The presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroup. Historical changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of reconstructed land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. Woodland cover was used to estimate changes in forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. Woodland cover decline was 52.9 (24.9-70.5) % in the past 50 years, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered (plausible bounds Least Concern to Endangered) under subcriterion A1.</Summary>

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) were used which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averdaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in resource use intensity were estimated by reclassifying the reconstructed land cover classes for 1900 and 2000 from the Anthrome products (Ellis et al. 2010). The potential distribution of the Macrogroup was crossed with the distinct woodland cover classes, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). The class 'Natural woodlands' were assumed to represent natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural' less than 'Used' less than 'Populated' less than 'Residential'). Equal step weights were considered for changes between consecutive classes, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse is not available, but it is assumed that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) was applied for the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters, distance to markets for wildlife products and level of protection (Benítez-López et al. 2017).

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">This chapter of the Red List of Ecosystems in America assesses the forests macrogroups of America and the Caribbean, therefore, 136 ecosystems units were assessed according to the methodology of the Red List of Ecosystem Categories and Criteria. This region is comprised of a wide range of forest assemblages. Some threats of which these ecosystems are prone to are elimation of tree cover, defaunation, expansion of grazing stock and climate change. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types. </Assessment-summary>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 was used. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

For contemporary forest cover we averaged percent tree cover from two time series of remote sensing data for each year between 2001 and 2012, and we calculated the proportional rate of decline (PRD) and used the difference in the predicted forest cover in 2001 and 2051 as an estimate of expected decline in any 50 year period including past, present and future.  Mean estimated decline was 32.7 (15.2-46.6) % and was close to the thresholds for Vulnerable, so it was considered to be Near Threatened</Summary>

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables as indicators of overall environmental conditions were selected and compared current and future conditions. “Current” climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005)⁠; while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014)⁠. All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The *random forest* (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002)⁠ to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. Partition data in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation⁠. Then the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes⁠, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and  different threshold of model support (proportion of “votes”, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box, RF-model prediction (as proportion of votes for the focal class) was used as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions based on current climatic condition (initial value) were compared and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017)⁠. This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) was applied for the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters, distance to markets for wildlife products and level of protection (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Then, transformed the spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. Mean relative severity was 47.1. 34.3 % of the extent had a relative severity of 80 % or higher, exceeding the threshold for Vulnerable.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables was implemented: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage was transformed. For negative RR values the decline was expressed as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values a zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. The formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

Potential distribution of the Macrogroup with the distinct woodland cover classes was estimated, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). The class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential'). Equal step weights for changes between consecutive classes was considered, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse was not available, but assume that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural'  less than  'Used'  less than  'Populated'  less than  'Residential').</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">This chapter of the Red List of Ecosystems in America assesses the forests macrogroups of America and the Caribbean, therefore, 136 ecosystems units were assessed according to the methodology of the Red List of Ecosystem Categories and Criteria. This region is comprised of a wide range of forest assemblages. Some threats of which these ecosystems are prone to are elimation of tree cover, defaunation, expansion of grazing stock and climate change. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types. </Assessment-summary>

<Subset-description lang="en">The '1.A.1.El.574 - Central Andes Seasonal Dry Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.1.El Tropical Andean Montane Dry Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. These forests are dense, tall and with various levels of understory with several woody lianas. This ecosystem is characterized by 46 characteristic species extracted from descriptive profiles of the Macrogroup and related ecological systems. Main threats in the ecosystem are increasing of human population, deforestation, defaunation, grazing and climate change.</Subset-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.1.El.574 - Central Andes Seasonal Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that, at the present rate of decline in tree cover, the geographic distribution could decline 41.3 % in a 50-year period; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable under sub-criterion A2b. Uncertainty in this estimate (90% C.I. 40.2-42.3 %) remains within the thresholds for this category. Thus the overall category is Vulnerable.</RA-Summary>

Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b).

Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables as indicators of overall environmental conditions were selected and compared current and future conditions. “Current” climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005)⁠; while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014)⁠. All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The *random forest* (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002)⁠ to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. Partition data in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation⁠. Then the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes⁠, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and  different threshold of model support (proportion of “votes”, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box, RF-model prediction (as proportion of votes for the focal class) was used as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions based on current climatic condition (initial value) were compared and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017)⁠. This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables was implemented: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage was transformed. For negative RR values the decline was expressed as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values a zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. The formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">This chapter of the Red List of Ecosystems in America assesses the forests macrogroups of America and the Caribbean, therefore, 136 ecosystems units were assessed according to the methodology of the Red List of Ecosystem Categories and Criteria. This region is comprised of a wide range of forest assemblages. Some threats of which these ecosystems are prone to are elimation of tree cover, defaunation, expansion of grazing stock and climate change. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types. </Assessment-summary>

For assessing disruption to biotic processes and interactions under criterion D was assumed that most of the fundamental processes and interactions disappeared with intensive use of woodlands under high population density.

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.1.El.575 - Boliviano Tucumano Seasonal Dry Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that, at the present rate of decline in tree cover, the geographic distribution could decline 32.2 % in a 50-year period. This is very close to the minimum threshold to assign a risk category; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under sub-criterion A2b. Uncertainty in this estimate (90% C.I. 28.4-35.9 %) suggests a plausible range from Least Concern to Vulnerable. Estimates of relative severity and extent of potential defaunation were close to the thresholds for Vulnerable, so it was considered to be Near Threatened under subcriterion 31. Thus the overall category is Near Threatened with plausible bounds Near Threatened to Vulnerable.</RA-Summary>

<Summary lang="en">For this macrogroup, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Subcriterion A2b was close to the threshold for Vulnerable, thus under this criterion this Macrogroup is considered Near Threatened.</Summary>

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000 was used. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area.

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes were converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 were averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model  was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution. </Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover two time series of data were considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS  (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover was calculated per year. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. It was converted land cover classes to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Then averaged percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). A cutoff value of 25% tree cover to determine presence was used, overlaped this with a 10x10 km grid, and counted the number of 10x10 km cells that had at least 1% of their area occupied the the ecosystem.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables as indicators of overall environmental conditions were selected and compared current and future conditions. “Current” climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005)⁠; while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014)⁠. All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The *random forest* (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002)⁠ to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. Partition data in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation⁠. Then the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes⁠, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and  different threshold of model support (proportion of “votes”, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box, RF-model prediction (as proportion of votes for the focal class) was used as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions based on current climatic condition (initial value) were compared and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017)⁠. This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables was implemented: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the  main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected . Spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage was transformed. For negative RR values the decline was expressed as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values a zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula represents the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. The formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

 <Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.A.2.Eg.281 - Caribbean Lowland Humid Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.2.Eg Caribbeo-Mesoamerican Lowland Humid Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This macrogroup is characterized by a regular dry season and average monthly rainfall of 100 mm or more. rainfall 1,800-3,200 mm, annual temperature from 18 to 24 ° C; forests on white sandy soil, on clay soil or on limestone, yellowish red soils; calcareous and alluvial soils, soils derived from volcanic and sedimentary geologies and poor ferralitic soils. It is characterized by humid forests with a high canopy, closed and generally without emergent trees; dominant canopy species vary from island to island, 30-35 m high, and three layers of trees. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It is located in the northern part of eastern Cuba, northern Jamaica, eastern Dominican Republic, northern Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, and small areas in the Lesser Antilles.

It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 53.5 (24.4-71.4) % in the past 50 years, will be 34.5 (19.1-46.9) % in a 50-year period, and was  80.9 (64.8-89.7) % historically. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 11.2 % in the past 50 years and 24.8 % historically over 100% of its extent, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 70.6%, however, 57.7 % of the extent had a relative severity of 80 % or higher. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriteria A1, A3 and D2b.</RA-Summary>

<Summary lang="en">For the Caribbean Lowland Humid Forest, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was 53.5 (24.4-71.4) % in the past 50 years, will be 34.5 (19.1-46.9) % in a 50-year period, and was  80.9 (64.8-89.7) % historically, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriteria A1 and A3.</Summary>

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averdaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">For criterion D large vertebrates was considered (and specially large mammals) as characteristic component of forests, and their due to overexploitation has an impact in important biotic associations in ecosystems (Galetti and Dirzo 2013; Dirzo et al. 2014). Recent estimates of hunting-depletion distances were used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). No reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale were found, but it was considered that increased human use intensity could be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 11.2 % in the past 50 years and 24.8 % historically over 100% of its extent, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 70.6, however, 57.7 % of the extent had a relative severity of 80 % or higher, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion D2b.</Summary>

The class 'Natural woodlands' were assumed to represent natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural' less than 'Used' less than 'Populated' less than 'Residential'). Equal step weights were considered for changes between consecutive classes, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse is not available, but it is assumed that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

 <Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This macrogroup has humid climate, if it is seasonal, the dry season is short, annual precipitation is generallymore than 3,000 mm. This forests are very diverse and dense, 30 m high, forests with emergent vegetation up to 40 m high with various strata, rich in palms, epiphytes and lianas. They are found on hilly to uneven terrain, with well-drained soils and sedimentary origin. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. They are located in Mexico and Central America. Atlantic slope of Central America and Mexico. Pacific slope of Central America, Mexico, the Colombian Chocó and the north coast of Ecuador. Honduras, Belize, Guatemala and southern Mexico.</AT-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.2.Eg.578 - Mesoamerican Lowland Humid Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that, at the present rate of decline in tree cover, the geographic distribution could decline was 25.4 (17.3-32.7) % in the past 50 years, could be 71.2 (66.5-75.2) % and was 45.9 (41.9-49.5) % historically. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data for changes in climate conditions was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates. Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 23.9 % in the past 50 years and 31.6 % historically; while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 35.9 % in a 50-year period, but the estimates of relative severity and extent were close to the thresholds for Vulnerable.

Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: "woodlands" cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was 25.4 (17.3-32.7) % in the past 50 years, will be 71.2 (66.5-75.2) % and was 45.9 (41.9-49.5) % historically, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion A2b.</Summary>

Historical changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of reconstructed land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. Woodland cover was used to estimate changes in forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years.

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) were used which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover two time series of data were considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averdaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) were used which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 400 years.

Thus, climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but a reliable indicator was not found for changes in fire regime at the continental scale.

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

Recent estimates of hunting-depletion distances were used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale were not found, but increased human use intensity was considered to be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resourse use intensity mean relative severity was 23.9 % in the past 50 years and 31.6 % historically; while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 35.9 % in a 50-year period, but the estimates of relative severity and extent were close to the thresholds for Vulnerable, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under subcriterion D2b.</Summary>

<Summary lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) was applied for the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites with three variables: distance to access points for hunters, distance to markets for wildlife products and level of protection (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Then, transformed the spatial estimate of RR to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. Potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 35.9 % in a 50-year period, but the estimates of relative severity and extent were close to the thresholds for Vulnerable, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under subcriterion D2b.</Summary>

<Rationale lang="en">The ecosystem will undergo a disruption of biotic processes or interactions of 35.9% severity over 100% of its extent in a 50-year period. This is very close to the minimum threshold to assign a risk category; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under subcriterion D2b.</Rationale>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

The potential distribution of the Macrogroup was crossed with the distinct woodland cover classes, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). Changes in resource use intensity has a mean relative severity of 31.6% historically, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Least Concern under subcriterion D3.</Summary>

The potential distribution of the Macrogroup was crossed with the distinct woodland cover classes, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). The class 'Natural woodlands' were assumed to represent natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural' less than 'Used' less than 'Populated' less than 'Residential'). Equal step weights were considered for changes between consecutive classes, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse is not available, but it is assumed that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse.</Data-description>

 <Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.A.2.Eg.873 - Mesoamerican Submontane Humid Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.2.Eg Caribbeo-Mesoamerican Lowland Humid Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This macrogroup  is characterized by precipitationmore than 2,000 mm per year. Mountainous region of tertiary origin with molisol, alfisol, ultisol soils, well drained and with a high organic content; in some parts there may be rock outcrops, although this is not common, and it is also made up of acidic, clay soils and generally well drained. It presents broadleaf and evergreen species, in some communities there are palms and in general the structure of the forests is complex, with numerous epiphytes, lianas and several woody strata, in addition to a closed canopy that reaches 20-40 m high. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It is located in north of Central America, the Atlantic slope in Costa Rica and both slopes in the mountains of the western region and those of the Panama Canal area.</AT-description>

<Subset-description lang="en">This assessment refers to the entire distribution of the Mesoamerican Submontane Humid Forest. This macrogroup  is characterized by precipitationmore than 2,000 mm per year. Mountainous region of tertiary origin with molisol, alfisol, ultisol soils, well drained and with a high organic content; in some parts there may be rock outcrops, although this is not common, and it is also made up of acidic, clay soils and generally well drained. It presents broadleaf and evergreen species, in some communities there are palms and in general the structure of the forests is complex, with numerous epiphytes, lianas and several woody strata, in addition to a closed canopy that reaches 20-40 m high. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It is located in north of Central America, the Atlantic slope in Costa Rica and both slopes in the mountains of the western region and those of the Panama Canal area.</Subset-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.2.Eg.873 - Mesoamerican Submontane Humid Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that, at the present rate of decline in tree cover, the geographic distribution could decline was 24.8 (17.4-31.6) % in the past 50 years, will be 58.2 (54.8-61.5) % in a 50-year period, and 44.4 (40.9-47.8) % historically. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2 and the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, there is an observed or inferred spatial or functional continuing decline and the number of threat-defined locations is more than 10. Available data was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates for climate change conditions. Changes in resourse use intensity had a mean relative severity of 23.4 % in the past 50 years and 27.3 % historically over 100% of its extent, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 40.5 % in a 50-year period, but the estimates of relative severity and extent were close to the thresholds for Vulnerable. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion A2b.</RA-Summary>

Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: woodlands cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was 24.8 (17.4-31.6) % in the past 50 years, will be 58.2 (54.8-61.5) % in a 50-year period, and 44.4 (40.9-47.8) % historically, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion A2b.</Summary>

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) were used which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area.

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averdaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

Thus, climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but a reliable indicator was not found for changes in fire regime at the continental scale.

<Summary lang="en">Climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions as it might influence both the predominant growth form and characteristic biota. A set of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were used as indicators of characteristic environmental conditions (Hijmans et al. 2005) and used a Random Forest Classification algorithm to evaluate suitability of environmental conditions under current climate and future projections based on climate change models. The probability of the target macrogroup to be replaced by any forest or non-forest vegetation macrogroup under changing climatic conditions was evaluated. Available data was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Data Deficient under subcriterion C2a.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">For criterion D large vertebrates (and specially large mammals) were considered as a characteristic component of forests, and their due to overexploitation has an impact in important biotic associations in ecosystems (Galetti and Dirzo 2013; Dirzo et al. 2014).  Estimates of hunting-depletion distances was used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale was not found, but increased human use intensity could be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resourse use intensity had a mean relative severity of 23.4 % in the past 50 years and 27.3 % historically over 100% of its extent, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 40.5 % in a 50-year period, but the estimates of relative severity and extent were close to the thresholds for Vulnerable, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under subcriterion D2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

 <Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This macrogroup is characterized by an humid seasonal climate with good drainage. It has tall forests with multiple layers. The predominant composition is from the floristic region of the Cerrado but with Amazonian elements. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It is distributed in the transition zones of the Amazon basin (Cerrado and Chiquitania).</AT-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.2.Ek.597 - Cerrado Humid Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that, at the present rate of decline in tree cover, the geographic distribution decline was 37.9 (21.2 - 51.1)% in the past 50 years, is 69.5 (61.3 - 75.9)% in a 50-year period, and was 61.2 (51.9 - 68.7)% historically. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2 and the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, there is an observed or inferred spatial or functional continuing decline and the number of threat-defined locations is more than 10. Changes in climate conditions mean relative severity will be 39 (33.2 - 42.7) % in the next 50 years, but the estimates of relative severity and extent were close to the thresholds for Vulnerable. Changes in resource use intensity mean relative severity was 20.3 % in the past 50 years and 27.7% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 21% in a 50-year period. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion A2b.</RA-Summary>

<Summary lang="en">For the Cerrado Humid Forest, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, the presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence were selected: woodlands cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b).  Woodland cover decline was 37.9 (21.2 - 51.1) % in the past 50 years, is 69.5 (61.3 - 75.9)% in a 50-year period, and was 61.2 (51.9 - 68.7) % historically, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion A2b.</Summary>

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) were used which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover.

The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area.

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover two-time series of data were considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

Thus we considered climate change as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but we did not find a reliable indicator for changes in fire regime at the continental scale. Flood regime was not considered to be relevant to this ecosystem and was not evaluated. Mean relative severity will be 39 (33.2 - 42.7) % in the next 50 years, but the estimates of relative severity and extent will be close to the thresholds for Vulnerable, therefore the ecosystem was considered to be Near Threatened under subcriterion C2a.</Summary>

A set of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were used as indicators of characteristic environmental conditions (Hijmans et al. 2005) and used a Random Forest Classification algorithm to evaluate suitability of environmental conditions under current climate and future projections based on climate change models.

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

Changes in resource use intensity mean relative severity was 20.3 % in the past 50 years and 27.7% historically, while potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 21% in a 50-year period, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Least Concern under criterion D.</Summary>

  <Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

  <Data-description lang="en">Changes in resource use intensity were estimated by reclassifying the reconstructed land cover classes for 1700 and 2000 from the Anthrome products (Ellis et al. 2010). The potential distribution of the Macrogroup was crossed with the distinct woodland cover classes, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). The class 'Natural woodlands' were assumed to represent natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural' less than 'Used' less than 'Populated' less than 'Residential'). Equal step weights were considered for changes between consecutive classes, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse is not available, but it is assumed that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.3.Ej.613 - Bolivian-Tucuman Lower Montane Humid Forest' was based on 5 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that, at the present rate of decline in tree cover, the geographic distribution had declined 15.3 (12.4 - 18.1) % in the past 50 years, 30.9 (29.8 - 31.9)% historically, and could decline 32.2 (31.2 - 33.2)% in a 50-year period, which was close to the thresholds for Vulnerable. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates for climate change conditions. Changes in resource use intensity has a mean relative severity of 13 % in the past 50 years and 17% severity historically, while, potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 21% in a 50-year period. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened (plausible bounds Near Threatened to Vulnerable) under subcriterion A2b.</RA-Summary>

<Summaries>
<Summary lang="en">For the Bolivian-Tucuman Lower Montane Humid Forest, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence was selected: 'woodlands' cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b).  Woodland cover decline was of 15.3 (12.4 - 18.1) % in the past 50 years, was of 30.9 (29.8 - 31.9)% historically, and is of 32.2 (31.2 - 33.2)% in a 50-year period, and was close to the thresholds for Vulnerable, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened (plausible bounds Near Threatened to Vulnerable) under subcriterion A2b.</Summary>

The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years.

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averdaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

 <Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

Recent estimates of hunting-depletion distances were used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale were not found, but increased human use intensity was considered to be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010).

Equal step weights were considered for changes between consecutive classes, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse is not available, but it is assumed that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse.</Data-description>

 <Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.A.4.Em.646 - Pantanal Floodplain Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.A.4.Em Brazilian-Parana Swamp and Flooded Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This macrogroup is characterized by presenting seasonal precipitation. It has low and open deciduous forests, they are associated with wooded savannahs with abundant palm trees, they are not directly related to the riverside areas that are flooded seasonally. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. They are found in Brazil in the Pantanal region west of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do sul, southeast of Bolivia and northeast of Paraguay; they generally occupy the banks of the rivers and the topographically high areas of the flood plains that flow into the Paraguay river.</AT-description>

<RA-Summaries>
<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.A.4.Em.646 - Pantanal Floodplain Forest' was based on 6 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, estimated current changes in surface water, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 54.5 (22.5 - 73.3)% in the past 50 years, 57.5 (43.8 - 67.8) % in a 50-year period, and 80.8 (62.6 - 90.2)% historically. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data was not accurate enough to assess changes in climate confitions, and changes in surface water had a mean severity of 76%, however, 70.2 % of the extent had a relative severity of 80 % or higher. Changes in resource use intensity was a mean relative severity was 16% in the past 50 years and 16.5% historically, while, potential defaunation will have a mean relative severity of 27 % in a 50 year period. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered (plausible bounds Endangered to Critically Endangered) under subcriteria A1, A2b, A3 and C2b.</RA-Summary>

<Summaries>
<Summary lang="en">For the Pantanal Floodplain Forest, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence was selected: 'woodlands' cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was 54.5 (22.5 - 73.3)% in the past 50 years, will be 57.5 (43.8 - 67.8) % in a 50-year period, and was of 80.8 (62.6 - 90.2)% historically, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under criterion A.</Summary>

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) were used which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">Climate conditions are generally considered of great importance for the maintainance of forest vegetation and characteristic processes of several macrogroups, and were also incorporated in the process of macrogroup potential distribution modeling and validation. Thus, climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but a reliable indicator was not found for changes in fire regime at the continental scale. For this macrogroup permanent and temporal water bodies form a relevant element of the ecosystem and interact with characteristic biota (e.g. species tolerant to flooding and high ground water levels) and important processes (e.g. nutrient cycling, vegetation growth; Keddy et al. 2009). Flood regime and surface water were considered as an important component of these forest macrogroups. While, a global indicator of trends in water surface was used for this assessment (Pekel et al. 2016). Available data was not accurate enough to assess changes in climate confitions, and changes in surface water had a mean severity of 76%, however, 70.2 % of the extent had a relative severity of 80 % or higher, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion C2b.</Summary>

    <Summary lang="en">Climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions as it might influence both the predominant growth form and characteristic biota. A set of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were used as indicators of characteristic environmental conditions (Hijmans et al. 2005) and used a Random Forest Classification algorithm to evaluate suitability of environmental conditions under current climate and future projections based on climate change models. The probability of the target macrogroup to be replaced by any forest or non-forest vegetation macrogroup under changing climatic conditions was evaluated.

 <Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">The Global Surface Water Dataset (GSW; Pekel et al. 2016) was used to estimate the spatial and temporal change in the distribution of surface water within the potential distribution of all macrogroups related to flood regimes. The GSW Surface Water Occurrence and Occurrence Change Intensity map layers provides information on overall surface water occurrence and increase or decrease of surface water occurrence between two epochs spanning the last 32 years: 1984-1999 and 2000-2015. The Macrogroups potential distribution maps and the GSW occurrence layer were overlapped to calculate the amount of area covered by surface water, and then overlapped the potential distribution maps and the GSW change layer to measure the amount of surface water area lost between epochs. The reference time period (1984-1999) represents the initial value and the recent time period (2000-2015) represent the final value. 85% decline was set as the collapse threshold. This value was considered to represent a reasonable estimate of minimum expected decline for a 50 year window including past, present and future and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2b.</Data-description>

 <Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.B.2.Ee.656 - Valdivian Lower Montane Deciduous Forest' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.B.2.Ee Valdivian Cool Temperate Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This macrogroup is characterized by presenting a hyper-humid climate, and they are dominated by Nothofagus alpina, Nothofagus obliqua and Nothofagus dombeyi. In the most humid zone of the Coastal mountain range, the understory is dominated by evergreen shrubs and small trees, on the dry Andean slopes they are formed by Lomatia dentata, Sophora macrocarpa and sclerophyllous elements. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. They are distributed in the western zone of the Chilean Andes of the Bio-Bio and Araucania regions and in the cordillera of the Nahuebuta coast, occurring between 500-1,200 masl.</AT-description>

<Summaries>
<Summary lang="en">For the Valdivian Lower Montane Deciduous Forest, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence was selected: 'woodlands' cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 25.8 (19.8 - 31.4)% in the past 50 years, was of 48.4 (45.4 - 51.2)% historically, and is of 37.2 (25.6 - 47.0)% in a 50-year period; nevertheless, spatial data was inconsistent, thus, considering no reliable information is available to assess this macrogroup this criterion was not assessed.</Summary>

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) were used which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averdaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

Then, percent tree cover was averaged from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). A cutoff value of 25% tree cover was used to determine presence, and estimated the extent of occurrence as the minimum convex polygon around the presence data.</Data-description>

Thus, climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but a reliable indicator was not found for changes in fire regime at the continental scale. Flood regime was not considered to be relevant to this ecosystem and was not evaluated. The abiotic data for this Macrogroup was inconsistent, therefore, the ecosystem was Not Evaluated</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

Recent estimates of hunting-depletion distances were used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale were not found, but increased human use intensity was considered to be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Resource use intensity mean relative severity was 8.8% in the past 50 years and 28.6% severity historically, while, potential defaunation was not assessed; nevertheless, functional data was inconsistent, thus, considering no reliable information is available to assess this macrogroup this criterion was not assessed.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

This macrogroup presents well decomposed peat soils or humid soils rich in minerals, the substrate has a coarse texture; the system is supported by sedimentary rocks, the soils are acidic to circumneutral, with a pH between 3.1 to 6.5; while, high values of soil organic matter, total exchange capacity, exchangeable nitrogen, sulfur and soluble phosphorus are typical. Most soils are low in boron, copper, potassium and manganese, they can be mineral or mud (well decomposed peat), mud or mineral with a fine texture. The mineral soil substrate is covered by an organic, but not variable layer of peat. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. Wind is a dominant natural disturbance generating small-scale canopy gaps. Another type of disturbance is selective logging, which also influences the structure and dominance of this macrogroup; groundwater, surface water dynamics, and hydrological processes influence swamp and conifer forests.The more central portions contain shrub swamps, reed swamps, wet meadows, and open swamps. Wooded bogs are dominated by Picea rubens. This system is made up of the pine wetlands and the plains coastal peatlands of New Jersey; vegetation is characterized by variable hydroperiod associations, occurring on a range of substrates from deep saturated peat to seasonally saturated mineral soils; vegetation is a mosaic of forests, woodlands, scrublands, and herbaceous communities. Canopy and canopy composition may vary within and between examples of this system. The macrogroup is distributed from New England to western Minnesota, south through the Appalachian Mountains to Virginia, and east of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Minimum elevations range from 730 m in the north to 940 m in the south (Droop Mountain, West Virginia). The maximum elevation is 1,422 m in Mount Porte Crayon, West Virginia. Scattered locations in New England and Canada adjacent to the west of the Great Lakes and northern Minnesota. It can be found in northern Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, the northern portion of the Massachusetts, sporadic occurrences north of Maine, and is historic in eastern Pennsylvania, it runs from Long Island, New York, New Jersey and south of the Maryland Inland Coastal Plain. This system occurs in the mid-Atlantic coastal plain from Virginia to New Jersey.</AT-description>

<Processes-Summary lang="en">In the Northern Swamp Forest, wind is a dominant natural disturbance generating small-scale canopy gaps. Another type of disturbance is selective logging, which also influences the structure and dominance of this macrogroup. Groundwater, surface water dynamics, and hydrological processes influence swamp and conifer forests. This system is maintained by a spatially complex mix of seepage, low-energy flooding, and precipitation. The more central portions contain shrub swamps, reed swamps, wet meadows, and open swamps. Wooded bogs are dominated by Picea rubens. This system is typically found in watersheds or floodplains with higher pH and / or nutrient levels. These swamps often occur on structurally weak organic soils, where the trees take shallow roots due to anaerobic conditions and are therefore particularly susceptible to wind caps. These wooded wetlands, found in basins where higher pH and / or nutrient levels are associated with rich flora, there may be shrub or herbaceous openings within the primarily wooded cover. The substrate is mainly mineral soil, but there may be some peat development. This system is composed of acidic peat bogs formed in basins of various sizes, predominantly white swamps and cedar of the Atlantic. Hydrology is saturated. This system is composed of riparian swamps and not seasonally flooded habitats, including relatively shallow subterranean caves and flat coastal terraces. This system is made up of the pine wetlands and the plains coastal peatlands of New Jersey. Vegetation is characterized by variable hydroperiod associations, occurring on a range of substrates from deep saturated peat to seasonally saturated mineral soils. Vegetation is a mosaic of forests, woodlands, scrublands, and herbaceous communities. Canopy and canopy composition may vary within and between examples of this system. This system is influenced by floods and groundwater seepage.</Processes-Summary>
<Processes-Summary lang="es">En los Bosques pantanosos norteños, el viento es una perturbación natural dominante generando claros del dosel a pequeña escala. Otro tipo de perturbación es la tala selectiva la cual también influye en la estructura y dominio de este macrogrupo. Las aguas subterráneas, la dinámica de aguas superficiales y los procesos hidrológicos influyen en los bosques de pantano y de coníferas. Este sistema es mantenido por una espacialmente compleja mezcla de filtraciones, inundaciones de baja energía y precipitaciones. Las porciones más centrales, contienen pantanos de arbustos, pantanos de juncos, prados húmedos y pantanos abiertos. Las ciénagas boscosas están dominadas por Picea rubens. Este sistema se encuentra típicamente en cuencas o en las llanuras de inundación con un pH más alto y / o los niveles de nutrientes. Estos pantanos a menudo se producen en suelos orgánicos estructuralmente débiles, donde los árboles arraigan superficialmente debido a las condiciones anaeróbicas y por lo tanto son particularmente susceptibles a ser volcados por el viento. Estos humedales boscosos, se encuentran en las cuencas donde los niveles de pH y / o nutrientes más altos se asocian con una rica flora, puede haber aberturas arbustivas o herbáceas dentro de la cubierta principalmente boscosa. El sustrato es principalmente suelo mineral, pero puede haber algún desarrollo de turba. Se compone de turberas ácidas formadas en las cuencas de varios tamaños, pantanos blanco y cedro predominantemente del Atlántico. La hidrología es saturada. Este sistema presenta pantanos ribereños y no hábitats inundados estacionalmente, incluyendo cavidades subterráneas de influencia relativamente poco profundas y terrazas costeras llanas. Este sistema se compone de los humedales de pino y las zonas costeras llanas turberas de Nueva Jersey. La vegetación se caracteriza por tener asociaciones de hidroperíodos variables, que se producen en una gama de sustratos de turbas profundas saturadas a suelos minerales saturados estacionalmente. La vegetación es un mosaico de bosques, matorrales y comunidades herbáceas. La composición del dosel y la cubierta puede variar dentro y entre los ejemplos de este sistema. Este sistema está influenciado por las inundaciones y filtración de aguas subterráneas.</Processes-Summary>

  <Subset-description lang="en">This assessment refers to the entire distribution of the Northern Swamp Forest.  This macrogroup presents well decomposed peat soils or humid soils rich in minerals, the substrate has a coarse texture; the system is supported by sedimentary rocks, the soils are acidic to circumneutral, with a pH between 3.1 to 6.5; while, high values of soil organic matter, total exchange capacity, exchangeable nitrogen, sulfur and soluble phosphorus are typical. Most soils are low in boron, copper, potassium and manganese, they can be mineral or mud (well decomposed peat), mud or mineral with a fine texture. The mineral soil substrate is covered by an organic, but not variable layer of peat. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. Wind is a dominant natural disturbance generating small-scale canopy gaps. Another type of disturbance is selective logging, which also influences the structure and dominance of this macrogroup; groundwater, surface water dynamics, and hydrological processes influence swamp and conifer forests.The more central portions contain shrub swamps, reed swamps, wet meadows, and open swamps. Wooded bogs are dominated by Picea rubens. This system is made up of the pine wetlands and the plains coastal peatlands of New Jersey; vegetation is characterized by variable hydroperiod associations, occurring on a range of substrates from deep saturated peat to seasonally saturated mineral soils; vegetation is a mosaic of forests, woodlands, scrublands, and herbaceous communities. Canopy and canopy composition may vary within and between examples of this system. The macrogroup is distributed from New England to western Minnesota, south through the Appalachian Mountains to Virginia, and east of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Minimum elevations range from 730 m in the north to 940 m in the south (Droop Mountain, West Virginia). The maximum elevation is 1,422 m in Mount Porte Crayon, West Virginia.

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.B.3.Na.504 - Northern Swamp Forest' was based on 6 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, estimated current changes in surface water, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 18 (3.7-30.2)% in the past 50 years, 58.3 (51.4-64.3)% historically, and will be of 17.9 (7.2 -27.5)% in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data was not accurate enough to assess changes in climate confitions, and changes in surface water has a mean severity of 20.5% in a 50-year period. Changes in resource use intensity had a mean relative severity of 3.9% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 7.1% historically, while no reliable information is available to assess potential defaunation. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable (plausible bounds Near Threatened to Vulnerable) under subcriterion A3.</RA-Summary>

<Summary lang="en">For the Northern Swamp Forest, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence was selected: 'woodlands' cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 18 (3.7-30.2)% in the past 50 years, declined 58.3 (51.4-64.3)% historically, and will be of 17.9 (7.2 -27.5)% in a 50-year period, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable (plausible bounds Near Threatened to Vulnerable) under subcriterion A3.</Summary>

The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years.

Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">Climate conditions are generally considered of great importance for the maintainance of forest vegetation and characteristic processes of several macrogroups, and were also incorporated in the process of macrogroup potential distribution modeling and validation. Thus, climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but a reliable indicator was not found for changes in fire regime at the continental scale. For this macrogroup permanent and temporal water bodies form a relevant element of the ecosystem and interact with characteristic biota (e.g. species tolerant to flooding and high ground water levels) and important processes (e.g. nutrient cycling, vegetation growth; Keddy et al. 2009). Flood regime and surface water were considered as an important component of these forest macrogroups. While, a global indicator of trends in water surface was used for this assessment (Pekel et al. 2016).

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

A global indicator of trends in water surface (Pekel et al. 2016) was considered to assess this subcriterion. Changes in surface water has a mean severity of 20.5% in a 50-year period, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Least Concern under subcriterion C2b.</Summary>

<Rationales>
<Rationale lang="en">The ecosystem will undergo an environmental degradation of 20.5% severity over 100% of its extent in a 50-year period. This is below the minimum threshold to assign a risk category; thus, the ecosystem is classified as Least Concern under subcriterion C2b.</Rationale>

<Data-description lang="en">The Global Surface Water Dataset (GSW; Pekel et al. 2016) was used to estimate the spatial and temporal change in the distribution of surface water within the potential distribution of all macrogroups related to flood regimes. The GSW Surface Water Occurrence and Occurrence Change Intensity map layers provides information on overall surface water occurrence and increase or decrease of surface water occurrence between two epochs spanning the last 32 years: 1984-1999 and 2000-2015. The Macrogroups potential distribution maps and the GSW occurrence layer were overlapped to calculate the amount of area covered by surface water, and then overlapped the potential distribution maps and the GSW change layer to measure the amount of surface water area lost between epochs. The reference time period (1984-1999) represents the initial value and the recent time period (2000-2015) represent the final value. 85% decline was set as the collapse threshold. This value was considered to represent a reasonable estimate of minimum expected decline for a 50 year window including past, present and future and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2b.</Data-description>

Recent estimates of hunting-depletion distances were used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale were not found, but increased human use intensity was considered to be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resource use intensity had a mean relative severity of 3.9% in the past 50 years, and a mean relative severity 7.1% historically, while no reliable information is available to assess potential defaunation, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Least Concern under criterion D.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.B.3.Nb.32 - Southern Coastal Plain Evergreen Hardwood and Conifer Swamp' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.B.3.Nb Southeastern North American Flooded and Swamp Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. In this macrogroup, the soils can be wet sands or mixtures of organic soils (peat) and mineral soils, which are often extremely poor in nutrients; they have quick drainage. The soils within the system itself are generally clays, or deeper organic soils; they can range from sand to clay to organic. very acid soils, poor in nutrients, and have a high capacity for available water and surface runoff is too slow to stagnate. The soils are generally sandy loam, often with an impermeable subsoil layer that restricts water percolation. It presents evergreen forests and wetlands dominated by evergreen trees and shrubs; in general, it is a dense shrub layer that consists mainly of species shared with the Atlantic coastal plain, dominated by mixed evergreen and deciduous forest. The vegetation of this system is characterized by mixed hardwood species, often with common hydric oak species; these are mainly evergreen forests that are generally found at the base of slopes or other habitats where seepage flow is concentrated. This ecological system consists of forested wetlands (often heavily forested). In most cases, these wetlands are embedded in the highlands with deep sandy soils. Due to excessive humidity, these habitats are normally protected from fire, except those that occur during periods of extreme drought; these environments are prone to long-term standing water, and tend to have very acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It an be found from southeastern Virginia to eastern Texas, extending into central Florida and north of the interior to southern Arkansas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma; it is also found on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, Florida, Georgia, and rarely in southern Alabama.</AT-description>

Some associations may have Chamaecyparis thyoides present, however this is not diagnostic for this macrogroup. Understory: Smilax laurifoliaen present throughout the region. Vegetation consists of open forests or closed acid-tolerant or pine forests of wetlands. In general, it is a dense shrub layer that consists mainly of species shared with the Atlantic coastal plain. They are dominated by mixed evergreen and deciduous forest. The vegetation of this system is characterized by mixed hardwood species, often with common hydric oak species. These are mainly evergreen forests that are generally found at the base of slopes or other habitats where seepage flow is concentrated. This ecological system consists of forested wetlands (often heavily forested). The vegetation is characterized by a canopy of Magnolia virginiana, Nyssa sylvatica, Nyssa biflora, and Acer rubrum, although there are some variations according to latitude. Understory vegetation throughout the region consistently supports Smilax laurifolia and Smilax walteri vines, and a dense abundance of ferns, such as Osmunda cinnamomea.

  <Subset-description lang="en">This assessment refers to the entire distribution of the Southern Coastal Plain Evergreen Hardwood and Conifer Swamp. In this macrogroup, the soils can be wet sands or mixtures of organic soils (peat) and mineral soils, which are often extremely poor in nutrients; they have quick drainage. The soils within the system itself are generally clays, or deeper organic soils; they can range from sand to clay to organic. very acid soils, poor in nutrients, and have a high capacity for available water and surface runoff is too slow to stagnate. The soils are generally sandy loam, often with an impermeable subsoil layer that restricts water percolation. It presents evergreen forests and wetlands dominated by evergreen trees and shrubs; in general, it is a dense shrub layer that consists mainly of species shared with the Atlantic coastal plain, dominated by mixed evergreen and deciduous forest. The vegetation of this system is characterized by mixed hardwood species, often with common hydric oak species; these are mainly evergreen forests that are generally found at the base of slopes or other habitats where seepage flow is concentrated. This ecological system consists of forested wetlands (often heavily forested). In most cases, these wetlands are embedded in the highlands with deep sandy soils. Due to excessive humidity, these habitats are normally protected from fire, except those that occur during periods of extreme drought; these environments are prone to long-term standing water, and tend to have very acidic, nutrient-poor soils. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It an be found from southeastern Virginia to eastern Texas, extending into central Florida and north of the interior to southern Arkansas and extreme southeastern Oklahoma; it is also found on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, Florida, Georgia, and rarely in southern Alabama.</Subset-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.B.3.Nb.32 - Southern Coastal Plain Evergreen Hardwood and Conifer Swamp' was based on 6 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, estimated current changes in surface water, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. Woodland cover declined 11.4 (5.5 -17.0) % in the past 50 years, declined 37.8 (35.3-40.2)% historically and will decline  37.8 (0.0-64.7) % in a 50-year period, this was close to the thresholds for Vulnerable. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data was not accurate enough to assess changes in climate confitions, and changes in surface water has a mean severity of 37.1% in a 50-year period, but the estimates of relative severity and extent were close to the thresholds for Vulnerable. Changes in resource use intensity had a mean relative severity of 13.2% in the past 50 year, and 54.9% historically, while no reliable information is available to assess potential defaunation, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion D3.</RA-Summary>

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) were used which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover two-time series of data were considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 400 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area.  For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1750 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">Climate conditions are generally considered of great importance for the maintainance of forest vegetation and characteristic processes of several macrogroups, and were also incorporated in the process of macrogroup potential distribution modeling and validation. Thus, climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but a reliable indicator was not found for changes in fire regime at the continental scale. For this macrogroup permanent and temporal water bodies form a relevant element of the ecosystem and interact with characteristic biota (e.g. species tolerant to flooding and high ground water levels) and important processes (e.g. nutrient cycling, vegetation growth; Keddy et al. 2009). Flood regime and surface water were considered as an important component of these forest macrogroups. While, a global indicator of trends in water surface was used for this assessment (Pekel et al. 2016). Available data was not accurate enough to assess changes in climate confitions, and changes in surface water has a mean severity of 37.1% in a 50-year period, but the estimates of relative severity and extent were close to the thresholds for Vulnerable, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under subcriterion C2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">The Global Surface Water Dataset (GSW; Pekel et al. 2016) was used to estimate the spatial and temporal change in the distribution of surface water within the potential distribution of all macrogroups related to flood regimes. The GSW Surface Water Occurrence and Occurrence Change Intensity map layers provides information on overall surface water occurrence and increase or decrease of surface water occurrence between two epochs spanning the last 32 years: 1984-1999 and 2000-2015. The Macrogroups potential distribution maps and the GSW occurrence layer were overlapped to calculate the amount of area covered by surface water, and then overlapped the potential distribution maps and the GSW change layer to measure the amount of surface water area lost between epochs. The reference time period (1984-1999) represents the initial value and the recent time period (2000-2015) represent the final value. 85% decline was set as the collapse threshold.

According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">Changes in resource use intensity were estimated by reclassifying the reconstructed land cover classes for 1700 and 2000 from the Anthrome products (Ellis et al. 2010). The potential distribution of the Macrogroup was crossed with the distinct woodland cover classes, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). Changes in resource use intensity had a mean relative severity of 54.9% historically, however, 26.1 % of the extent had a relative severity of 70 % or higher, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Endangered under subcriterion D3.</Summary>

The potential distribution of the Macrogroup was crossed with the distinct woodland cover classes, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). The class 'Natural woodlands' were assumed to represent natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural' less than 'Used' less than 'Populated' less than 'Residential'). Equal step weights were considered for changes between consecutive classes, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse is not available, but it is assumed that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

<AT-description lang="en">The '1.B.3.Nb.33 - Southern Coastal Plain Basin Swamp and Flatwoods' is a forest macrogroup belonging to the '1.B.3.Nb Southeastern North American Flooded and Swamp Forest' division in the International Vegetation Classification system (Faber-Langendoen et al. 2014). It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This macrogroup presents an humid climate and peat substrates. Soil moisture fluctuates widely throughout the season, ranging from saturated to very dry, a condition known as xerihydric. The soils have a clay texture and are from superficial to shallow. Acid silty loam soils. Soils can be clayey or go from shallow to deep organic. A small distinctive subset has soils with limestone near the surface, which influence soil chemistry. They are watershed forests with poor drainage and wet floors in the coastal plains, which present dense forests and other trees tolerant to wetland conditions; swamp herbaceous species are limited by long hydroperiods; ecological processes in wetlands are related to soil texture, moisture, and disturbance history.  Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. They are found in the Southeastern coastal plain of North America.</AT-description>

<Processes-Summary lang="en">The Southern Coastal Plain Basin Swamp and Flatwoods are watershed forests with poor drainage and wet floors in the coastal plains, which present dense forests and other trees tolerant to wetland conditions. In general, it presents a dense to moderately dense forest. Swamp herbaceous species are limited by long hydroperiods. In short, ecological processes in wetlands are related to soil texture, moisture, and disturbance history. This forest system occurs on broad upland floors in the Alabama coastal plain and the Mississippi Eastern Gulf, Known examples in the Alabama / Mississippi portions of the range include a mosaic of open forests dominated by Pinus taeda interspersed with patches of Quercus phellos and sometimes other tree species. The vegetation of this system is compatible with a relatively low diversity of vascular plants and therefore floristics similar to other types of pine-wood vegetation in the region may appear. The dry part of this vegetative mosaic is dominated by grass cover. This system encompasses forests, grasslands, and terraced forests of the Pleistocene in the Mississippi floodplain of Arkansas, Missouri, and Louisiana. These sites are very wet in the winter / spring and very dry in the summer, due to this humidity regime, the communities are variable, ranging from willow oak flooring to prairie oak flooring. The wood combination and dominant non-riparian deciduous canopy distinguishes this system from other coastal plain systems. They are generally wooded; the vegetation is characterized by evergreen "bay" shrubs, and / or mixed hardwoods.</Processes-Summary>
<Processes-Summary lang="es">Los pantanos y flatwoods de la cuenca de la llanura costera del sur son bosques de cuencas con drenaje pobre y de suelos húmedos en las llanuras costeras, los cuales presentan bosques frondosos y otros árboles tolerantes a las condiciones de humedales. En general, presenta un bosque de denso a moderadamente denso. Las especies herbáceas de los pantanos están limitados por hidroperíodos largos. Los procesos ecológicos en los pantanos se relacionan con la textura del suelo, la humedad y la historia de perturbación. Este sistema forestal se produce en pisos de tierras altas amplios en la llanura costera de Alabama y Golfo del Este en Mississippi. Los ejemplos conocidos en las partes de Alabama / Mississippi, incluyen un mosaico de bosques abiertos dominados por Pinus taeda intercalados con manchas de Quercus phellos y a veces otras especies de árboles. La vegetación de este sistema es compatible con la relativamente baja diversidad de plantas vasculares y por lo tanto puede aparecer florísticamente similar a otros tipos de vegetación de pino-madera de la región. La parte seca de este mosaico vegetacional está dominado por la cubierta de hierba. Este sistema abarca bosques, praderas y bosques en las terrazas del Pleistoceno en el Mississippi llanura aluvial de Arkansas, Missouri y Louisiana. Estos sitios son muy húmedos en el invierno / primavera y muy secos en el verano, debido a este régimen de humedad, las comunidades son variables, que van desde pisos de roble de sauce para colocar pisos de roble de praderas. La combinación de madera y dominantes del dosel de hojas caducas y no ribereños distingue este sistema de otros sistemas de la planicie costera. Son generalmente boscosas; la vegetación se caracteriza por ser de hoja perenne "bahía" arbustos, y / o maderas duras mixtas.</Processes-Summary>

  <Subset-description lang="en">This assessment refers to the entire distribution of the 1.B.3.Nb.33 - Southern Coastal Plain Basin Swamp and Flatwoods. This macrogroup presents an humid climate and peat substrates. Soil moisture fluctuates widely throughout the season, ranging from saturated to very dry, a condition known as xerihydric. The soils have a clay texture and are from superficial to shallow. Acid silty loam soils. Soils can be clayey or go from shallow to deep organic. A small distinctive subset has soils with limestone near the surface, which influence soil chemistry. They are watershed forests with poor drainage and wet floors in the coastal plains, which present dense forests and other trees tolerant to wetland conditions; swamp herbaceous species are limited by long hydroperiods; ecological processes in wetlands are related to soil texture, moisture, and disturbance history.  Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. They are found in the Southeastern coastal plain of North America.</Subset-description>

<RA-Summaries>
<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.B.3.Nb.33 - Southern Coastal Plain Basin Swamp and Flatwoods' was based on 6 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, estimated current changes in surface water, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. Woodland cover decline was of 28.3 (24.9-31.5) in the past 50 years, 61.5 (59.8- 63.2)% historically and will be of  20.2 (0.0-49.9) % in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Available data was not accurate enough to assess changes in climate confitions, and changes in surface water has a mean severity of 19.3% in a 50-year period. Changes in resource use intensity had a mean relative severity of 6.1% in the past 50 years,and a mean relative severity of 50.6% historically, however, 82 % of the extent had a relative severity of 50 % or higher, while no reliable information is available to assess potential defaunation. Therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Vulnerable under subcriteria A3 and D3.</RA-Summary>

<Summaries>
<Summary lang="en">For the Southern Coastal Plain Basin Swamp and Flatwoods, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence was selected: 'woodlands' cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 28.3 (24.9-31.5) in the past 50 years, 61.5 (59.8- 63.2)% historically and will be of  20.2 (0.0-49.9) % in a 50-year period.

For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) were used which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area.

GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">Climate conditions are generally considered of great importance for the maintainance of forest vegetation and characteristic processes of several macrogroups, and were also incorporated in the process of macrogroup potential distribution modeling and validation. Thus, climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but a reliable indicator was not found for changes in fire regime at the continental scale. For this macrogroup permanent and temporal water bodies form a relevant element of the ecosystem and interact with characteristic biota (e.g. species tolerant to flooding and high ground water levels) and important processes (e.g. nutrient cycling, vegetation growth; Keddy et al. 2009). Flood regime and surface water were considered as an important component of these forest macrogroups. While, a global indicator of trends in water surface was used for this assessment (Pekel et al. 2016). Available data was not accurate enough to assess changes in climate confitions, and changes in surface water has a mean severity of 19.3% in a 50-year period, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Least Concern under subcriterion C2b.</Summary>

<Summary lang="en">Climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions as it might influence both the predominant growth form and characteristic biota. A set of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were used as indicators of characteristic environmental conditions (Hijmans et al. 2005) and used a Random Forest Classification algorithm to evaluate suitability of environmental conditions under current climate and future projections based on climate change models. The probability of the target macrogroup to be replaced by any forest or non-forest vegetation macrogroup under changing climatic conditions was evaluated. Available data was not accurate enough, resulting in unreliable estimates, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Data Deficient under subcriterion C2a.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">The Global Surface Water Dataset (GSW; Pekel et al. 2016) was used to estimate the spatial and temporal change in the distribution of surface water within the potential distribution of all macrogroups related to flood regimes. The GSW Surface Water Occurrence and Occurrence Change Intensity map layers provides information on overall surface water occurrence and increase or decrease of surface water occurrence between two epochs spanning the last 32 years: 1984-1999 and 2000-2015. The Macrogroups potential distribution maps and the GSW occurrence layer were overlapped to calculate the amount of area covered by surface water, and then overlapped the potential distribution maps and the GSW change layer to measure the amount of surface water area lost between epochs. The reference time period (1984-1999) represents the initial value and the recent time period (2000-2015) represent the final value. 85% decline was set as the collapse threshold. This value was considered to represent a reasonable estimate of minimum expected decline for a 50 year window including past, present and future and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2b.</Data-description>

Recent estimates of hunting-depletion distances were used to assess potential ecosystem degradation severity and extent in tropical regions (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Reliable indicators of other important threatening processes like invasive species or selective logging at a continental scale were not found, but it was considered that increased human use intensity could be used as indirect indicator of those (Ellis et al. 2010). Changes in resource use intensity had a mean relative severity of 6.1% in the past 50 years,and a mean relative severity of 50.6% historically, however, 82 % of the extent had a relative severity of 50 % or higher, while no reliable information is available to assess potential defaunation.

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>

<Assessment-summary lang="en">IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) criteria and simple cost-efficiency analyses where applied to provide the first regional perspective on patterns of relative risk integrated across multiple threats from the Forests of the Americas and the Caribbean. Based on six indicators of ecosystem distribution and function, 80% of the forest types and 85% of the current forest area is potentially threatened based on RLE criteria. Twelve forest types are Critically Endangered due to past or projected future deforestation, and Tropical Dry Forests and Woodland have highest threat scores. To efficiently reduce risks to forest ecosystems at national levels, scenario analyses show that countries would need to combine large forest protection measures with focused actions, tailored to their sociopolitical context, to help restore ecological functions in a selection of threatened forest types.</Assessment-summary>

It is considered here as a proxy for a forest ecosystem type in a regional assessment of forest ecosystems in the Americas. This macrogroup has an humid to warm-temperate climate; average rainfall is 100-150 cm (40-60 inches); hurricanes and other extreme precipitation events provide for an unpredictable hydrological regime. Most of the Carolina bays in the Outer Coastal Plain occur in sandy sediments and are filled with peat, while most of the Carolina bays in the Inland Coastal Plain occur in clay sediments and have mineral soils with hard layers of clay.  it presents depression forest, wetlands or open forests dominated by deciduous conifers (Taxodium ascendens), with grassy shrubs or understory; the largest and oldest individual trees typically occupy the center of these wetlands, with smaller and younger individuals around the margins. The most humid sites have open water and floating leaves of aquatic vegetation, or swamp vegetation of tall grasses; drier sites often have an open canopy with evergreen shrubs and often a dense, often quite species-rich herbaceous stratum underneath. Increasing in human population density, higher intensity of agriculture, expansion of grazing stock, deforestation, climate change and defaunation are the macrogroup's main threats. It is found in the southeastern coastal plain in the United States.</AT-description>

<RA-Summary lang="en">The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem assessment of the Macrogroup '1.B.3.Nb.161 - Pond-cypress - Slash Pine Swamp' was based on 6 indicators evaluated over different time frames: past and historic decline in woodland cover, current extent and trends in tree cover, predicted future changes in climatic suitability, estimated current changes in surface water, past and historic changes in the intensity of land use, potential defaunation of medium and large mammals. It was estimated that the geographic distribution measured as woodland cover declined 30.4 (20.9-38.7)% in the past 50 years, 53.5 (48.5-57.9)% historically, and will be of 32.1 (1.0-53.4) % in a 50-year period, this was close to the thresholds for Vulnerable. Available data was not accurate enough to assess changes in climate confitions, and changes in surface water has a mean severity of 19.3% in a 50-year period. The EOO is more than 50,000 km2, the AOO is more than 50 10x10 km grid cells, and there are more than 10 threat-defined locations. Changes in resource use intensity has a mean relative severity of 23.3 % in the past 50-years, and 44.1% historically, while no reliable information is available to assess potential defaunation.

<Summary lang="en">For the Pond-cypress - Slash Pine Swamp, forest vegetation is the dominant and diagnostic growth form. Thus, presence of trees (as closed forest or woodlands) was considered as a characteristic element and the main indicator of spatial distribution of the macrogroups. In order to cover both historical and present changes in distribution, two different data sources that estimate tree presence was selected: 'woodlands' cover from historic biome and land use reconstruction (subcriteria A1 and A3), and percentage tree cover calculated from a combination of contemporary remote sensing data (subcriterion A2b). Woodland cover decline was of 30.4 (20.9-38.7)% in the past 50 years, 53.5 (48.5-57.9)% historically, and will be of 32.1 (1.0-53.4) % in a 50-year period, this was close to the thresholds for Vulnerable, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under criterion A.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in forest cover were measured by contrasting series of spatial layers from different sources of global extent. For historical representation of forest cover the Anthrome products (http://ecotope.org/anthromes/v2/data/, v 2.0, Ellis et al. 2010) were used which represent the reconstructed extent of different land cover classes for 1700, 1800, 1900 and 2000. The layers were reclassified and focused on woodland cover independent of use intensity (wild, used, populated and residential woodlands) to estimate changes in forest cover. The reclassified maps were crossed with the potential distribution of each Macrogroup in order to obtain an area estimate for each Macrogroup and each time-frame. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by interpolation of the area in the four time frames assuming a quadratic response curve to describe increasing or decreasing rates in the last 100 years. The curve was fitted with a generalized linear model fitted using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link to avoid negative estimates of area. For this subcriterion the curve to estimate the PRD between 1950 and 2000 was used.</Data-description>

<Data-description lang="en">For contemporary forest cover two-time series of data were considered: the Global Forest Cover based on Landsat mosaics (GFC, version 1.2, Hansen et al. 2013) and the land cover data derived from MODIS (MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010). GFC data represents estimates of percentage tree cover in 2000 and estimates of forest loss and gain between 2000 and 2014, from which total forest cover per year was calculated. MODIS LC data represents yearly estimates of land cover classes between 2001 and 2012, including several forest types, semi-natural and artificial land cover. Land cover classes was converted to percentage tree cover (100% for natural forest classes, 25% for mosaic vegetation, 0% otherwise). Percent tree cover from both sources for each year between 2001 and 2012 was averaged in order to partially correct over- and under-estimation of forest change due to increases in plantations and other artificial land uses (Song et al. 2014; Tropek et al. 2014). The estimated percentage tree cover of each year was summarized over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup to provide annual estimates of forest cover. The proportional rate of decline (PRD) was estimated by a generalized linear model fitted to the estimates per year using a quasipoisson error distribution and a log-link. For Macrogroups with a negative trend, the model was used to predict the expected remaining distribution in 50 years. The use of this model avoids negative estimates of the remaining distribution.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">Climate conditions are generally considered of great importance for the maintainance of forest vegetation and characteristic processes of several macrogroups, and were also incorporated in the process of macrogroup potential distribution modeling and validation. Thus climate change was considered as a plausible future threat of degradation of environmental conditions. Natural disturbances are considered within the IVC classification as processes influencing the dominant and characteristic growth forms and diagnostic species of formations, and can be greatly altered by human activities. Flood and fire regimes play an important role in forest formations, but no reliable indicator was obtained for changes in fire regime at the continental scale. For this macrogroup permanent and temporal water bodies form a relevant element of the ecosystem and interact with characteristic biota (e.g. species tolerant to flooding and high ground water levels) and important processes (e.g. nutrient cycling, vegetation growth; Keddy et al. 2009). Flood regime was considered and surface water as an important component of these forest macrogroups. A global indicator of trends in water surface was used for this assessment (Pekel et al. 2016). Available data was not accurate enough to assess changes in climate confitions, and changes in surface water has a mean severity of 39.1% in a 50-year period, however, the estimates of relative severity and extent were close to the thresholds for Vulnerable, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Near Threatened under subcriterion C2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A group of 19 standard bioclimatic variables were selected as indicators of overall environmental conditions and compared current and future conditions. Current climate is based on interpolation of weather station data from a reference time frame between 1960 and 1990 (Worldclim, v1.4; Hijmans et al. 2005); while future scenarios for the year 2050 were calculated for different combinations of global circulation models (GCM) and representative concentration pathways (RCP; IPCC 2014). All data was available in the same format, resolution and from the same source (http://worldclim.org). The random forest (RF) algorithm was used, which is a machine learning method based on an ensemble of classification trees (Liaw and Wiener 2002) to predict changes from a focal macrogroup to any of the associated forest or non-forest macrogroups. First a bounding box was defined around each target macrogroup, and take a spatially uniform random sample of locations. For each location the potential macrogroup was recorded according to the potential distribution map and the values of the 19 bioclimatic variables. The data was partitioned in calibration and test subsets (75 and 25% of the locations respectively) using a checkerboard pattern to reduce spatial autocorrelation. Then, the RF model was fitted with the calibration data, sample size for each classification tree was set to 2/3 of the calibration data, but allowing for a representative sample of all represented classes, number of variables per tree was set to five, other setting were set to default values. Models were considered accepted if nominal classification error for the focal class was lower than 20% in the test samples, and the area under the sensitivity and specificity curve (AUC) was higher than 85%. The first statistic measures the misclassification when using the modal class from the ensemble prediction which can be a combination of model performance error and natural overlap between related classes, the second one measures discrimination performance when considering only the focal class and different threshold of model support (proportion of votes, or proportion of classification trees assigning the focal class). Future prediction was only attempted when model performance on current data was acceptable. Future predictions were performed for each set of future bioclimatic conditions corresponding to five GCM (BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5) and four RCP (rcp26, rcp45, rcp60 and rcp85). In order to calculate relative severity for the indicator of changing climatic conditions over the whole bounding box a RF-model prediction was used (as proportion of votes for the focal class) as a measure of appropriate climatic conditions for the focal macrogroup, and considered the threshold for equal specificity and sensitivity as the threshold at which environmental conditions shift to favor a different macrogroup (collapse threshold, CT). Predictions were compared based on current climatic condition (initial value) and predictions based on each combination of GCM and RCP for 2050 (final value). The results were summarized of the 20 combinations of GCMs and RCP to calculate the best estimate and plausible bounds (range including 90% probabilities) for the threat category (Bland et al. 2017). This indicator measures the expected decline for the next 50 years and thus corresponds to subcriterion C2a.</Data-description>

The GSW Surface Water Occurrence and Occurrence Change Intensity map layers provides information on overall surface water occurrence and increase or decrease of surface water occurrence between two epochs spanning the last 32 years: 1984-1999 and 2000-2015. The Macrogroups potential distribution maps and the GSW occurrence layer were overlapped to calculate the amount of area covered by surface water, and then overlapped the potential distribution maps and the GSW change layer to measure the amount of surface water area lost between epochs. The reference time period (1984-1999) represents the initial value and the recent time period (2000-2015) represent the final value. 85% decline was set as the collapse threshold.

<Data-description lang="en">Changes in resource use intensity were estimated by reclassifying the reconstructed land cover classes for 1900 and 2000 from the Anthrome products (Ellis et al. 2010). The potential distribution of the Macrogroup was crossed with the distinct woodland cover classes, and calculated the proportion of area that changed between the two Anthromes layers from low intensity ('wild woodlands' or 'used woodlands') to high intensity of use ('populated woodlands' or 'residential woodlands'). The class 'Natural woodlands' were assumed to represent natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse ('Natural' less than 'Used' less than 'Populated' less than 'Residential'). Equal step weights were considered for changes between consecutive classes, thus a change from 'Natural' to 'Used' or from 'Used' to 'Populated' was represented as RS=25%, while a change from 'Natural' to 'Populated' or from 'Used' to 'Residential' would be represented by RS=50%, etc. A quantitative estimate of collapse is not available, but it is assumed that the class 'Natural woodlands' represents natural conditions and the other classes represent increasing amounts of disruption leading to collapse.</Data-description>

<Summary lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters, distance to markets for wildlife products and level of protection (Benítez-López et al. 2017). Then the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. No reliable information is available to assess the disruption of biotic processes or interactions in the ecosystem in a 50-year period, therefore, the ecosystem is classified as Data Deficient under subcriterion D2b.</Summary>

<Data-description lang="en">A simplified formula relating response ratios (RR) of the abundance of mammals in hunted and unhunted sites was applied with three variables: distance to access points for hunters (approximated by distance in km to the main road network, from Digital Chart of the World), distance to markets for wildlife products (approximated by the distance in km to major urban centers, calculated from urban land cover in MODIS LC, version 5.1, Friedl et al. 2010) and level of protection (approximated by the distribution of any kind of protected areas, from the World Database on Protected Areas, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2016). According to figures and detailed results from (Benítez-López et al. 2017), the following formula was used to estimate the expected RR from raster images representing the three variables: RR = -2.370 + 0.057 access + 0.010 market + 1.270 protected. Then, the spatial estimate of RR was transformed to an estimate of potential decline in mammal abundance as a percentage . For negative RR values the decline was estimated as: decline = (1-exp(RR)) * 100. For zero or positive RR values zero decline was assumed. An overall weighted estimate of percentage decline was calculated over the potential distribution of each Macrogroup, using mean forest cover between 2001 and 2012 as a weighting variable. The applied formula was assumed to represent the potential relative decline in mammal abundance and used a collapse threshold equivalent of 10% of the original abundance. It was assumed that the formula represents a current level of threat representative a 50 year window including past, present and future.</Data-description>
